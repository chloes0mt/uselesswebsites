We were not able to find a frog big enough to eat our contestants.",  "HOWEVER, if you’re still frozen by the time the timer goes off, we’ll turn you into a frog.", "Now do you really think we’d do that? We obviously don’t have magic powers.", "HOWEVER, if you’re still frozen by the time the timer goes off, we’ll force feed you frog legs, with no condiments.", "Yikes. Even we’re not that cruel. Besides, who would WANT to cook frogs? They’re so cute!", "HOWEVER, if you’re still frozen by the time the timer goes off, we’ll make you bathe in the essence of poison dart frogs.", "Due to budget cuts, we were not able to acquire any poison dart frogs, so I guess you’re safe from that.", "HOWEVER, if you’re still frozen by the time the timer goes off, we’ll cast a spell on you that will make you inclined to only communicate with frogs, which will alienate you from society.

So, we can’t do that either.", "HOWEVER, if you’re still frozen by the time the timer goes off, we’ll tape frogs to your head.", "Once again, due to budget cuts, we don’t have enough tape to do that.", "HOWEVER, if you’re still frozen by the time the timer goes off, we’ll blast frog sounds through a speaker on full volume directly into your ears.", "We don’t have a speaker. If we don’t have the budget for tape why do you think we’d have a speaker?", "This is so stupid", "Don’t worry, we’re going to get to the point. ", "I know what you’re probably wondering…", "Why is it called Frog Electric? What does electricity have to do with this?", "The electricity component comes in once the timer goes off and you’re still frozen.", "You’re probably thinking something along the lines of…I won’t even mention it here.
